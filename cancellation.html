          <strong>SHENTRON TECHNOLOGIES PRIVATE LIMITED</strong> believes in helping its customers as far as possible, and has therefore adopted a liberal cancellation policy. Under this policy:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>
            Cancellations will be considered only if the request is made immediately after placing the order. However, the cancellation request may not be entertained if the orders have been communicated to the vendors/merchants and they have initiated the process of shipping.
          </li>

          <li>
            We do not accept cancellation requests for perishable items like flowers or eatables. However, refunds or replacements can be made if the customer establishes that the delivered product quality was unsatisfactory.
          </li>

          <li>
            In case of damaged or defective items, please report the same to our Customer Service team on the same day of receipt. The request will be entertained only after verification by the merchant at their end.
          </li>

          <li>
            If the received product does not match what is shown on the site or is not as per expectations, please inform our customer service on the same day of receiving the product. After review, our team will take an appropriate decision.
          </li>

          <li>
            For products with manufacturer warranties, please raise the issue directly with the manufacturer.
          </li>

          <li>
            For any approved refunds by <strong>SHENTRON TECHNOLOGIES PRIVATE LIMITED</strong>, the amount will be processed back to the customer within 3–5 business days.
          </li>
